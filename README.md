## Getting Started

Blatand use native libraries for interacting with bluetooth, you must build and integrate them in your unity project:
 - For Android: Use [Android Bridge](https://github.com/blatand-unity/blatand-android-bridge)

### Why iOS support is not planned ?

Cause iOS development require Apple environment like XCode, etc... These are expensive technologies and the dev team can't afford to buy them.
